# Project-Lemon
A desktop application developed by me (Written in Python).
My purpose was to solve the problem of wasting time on unnecessary tasks.
The application takes voice commands from users and matches them with predefined sentence
structures to perform tasks like playing music, opening or creating files, sending emails, etc.,
eliminating the need for users to spend time on these tasks.
Requirements: Recognizing user voices, Matching them with proper commands, Executing the
commands.
